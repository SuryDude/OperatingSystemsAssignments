This lab is a program written in java.

To run this program you must have javac and java commands and a file for which you'll provide a path/name as input. You must compile all java files within src and run the program from Main with a file as the command line argument.

I have documented the various classes appropriately with in-line comments at various steps in the process. 

A short description of each file:
Two deadlock methods are listed as their name: Bank.java and Fifo.java.
Task.java defines the task class members, attributes and methods.
BlockQueue.java is where the definition of the blocked queue is located.
Main.java is the entrance of the program and where the program processes reading and the two methods.

FIFO is processed then Banker.

Instructions:
>cd Lab3-Banker/src
>javac *.java
>java Main <file>

example:
>javac *.java
>java Schedule ~/Desktop/input-05

Note: Will work inside or outside the src directory.
